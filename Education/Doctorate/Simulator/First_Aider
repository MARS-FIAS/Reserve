Introduction
	
	Hello my dear (new) user/developer!

	Welcome to our small piece of code. We have (obsesively) organized the "Simulator" directory to facilitate its navigation.
	This little text file was created with you as our primary goal; it will guide you easily and effectively around this directory.
	Our mission is not to provide you every possible detail, but we want to direct you to the proper places to facilitate your work.
	So, let's get started...

We decided to split the workflow for only two kinds of people: users, developers.
If you find any need to improve/refresh this intial help file, then keep the last premise in mind, please.

########
User mode
	
	* Our wise developer minions should have extensively documented their work,
	and they should have placed those documents under the folder "Help_Docs".
	This is where you should also find the folders "Directory_Description" and "Summary";
	both must have text files illustrating the structure and the goal of "Simulator".
	* Some useful tutorials should appear under "Examples".
	* Whatever file or program you would like to execute, it should be placed in the folder "Projects".
	* Unless you are also acting as developer, there's nothing to look for under "Resources". ;)

########
Developer mode
	
	* Your precious contribution stars when you master the internal structure of the folder "Resources".
	A detailed description of the whole concept of "Simulator" must be availble in the folder "Help_Docs".
	* Every new coding journey should begin by placing (and organizing) a proper directory under the "Projects" folder.
	Please, take time to write accessible documentation about your new scripts.
	* All our main definitions (e.g., classes, functions) are placed in different files accross the folder "Resources";
	needless to say, any extra definiton deemed relevant and general should be added in a smooth way to the existing ones.
	We certainly can't be precise about being "smooth", but it's important to understand the reasons behind the structure of our whole endevour.

Conclusion
	
	We hope you will enjoy using our humble tool!
	Thank you!
